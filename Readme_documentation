Columns in csv files are much larger in number, for this, mapping is created, extra columns are dropped and reordered in desired sequence.
dealer_transmission_type is not present in table, however present in the mapping
Renamed columns as per the mapping specified,
Removed extra columns
Created primary key hash column(which is sequential index), which is set as index
dealer_certified is also a column not present in csv file for provider2 file
Line plot is made on created pivot table based on the total number of vehicles and ploted accross the years 
The matplotlib is used for creating line graph
The output picture and db file is uploaded in output folder
Right now, you will have access to view the repository, when you are done checking, I will convert access tp private.
Thank you for the opportunity
